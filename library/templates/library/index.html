          <p> A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a
            private individual. Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people
            who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual
            can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing
            materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs. Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common
            areas to facilitate group study and collaboration. Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their
            electronic resources and the Internet.</p>

          <p> The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script
            discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. Private or personal libraries made up of written books
            appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC. Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places
            to get unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by
            providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating
            and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources. Libraries are increasingly
            becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning.n the 6th century,
            at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of
            Constantinople and Alexandria. The libraries of Timbuktu were also established around this time and attracted
            scholars from all over the world.</p>
